# Meterial_for_Application
by Zuqi Li

Dear Eva and Ivan,

I'm glad to hear from you and that I'm on the shortened list. The position still quite interests me and I'd like to share with you some of my code as attached.

The 1st script is Cross-Validated Random Forest to predict transcriptional balance by transcription factors. The 2nd script is for a Kaggle competition which classifies furniture images via Keras CNN. The 3rd script is a Jupyter notebook implementing a FCN model to recognize cells. 

I also work with R and Matlab thus can provide relevant code if you need. As for further interview, I want to let you know that until 24th of Jan. I won't have much spare time because of a report and defense of my current project. Anyhow, studying material and simple task are welcome and there will be enough time for them.

Feel free to contact me for any questions and look forward to your reply.
Best Regards
